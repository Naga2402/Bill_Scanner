## 📤 How to Share Your Figma Designs

### Option 1: Screenshots (Easiest) 📸

1. **Take screenshots** of each screen from Figma
2. **Save them here** in the `screens/` folder
3. **Name them clearly:**
   - `01_home_screen.png`
   - `02_scan_screen.png`
   - `03_bill_detail_screen.png`
   - `04_history_screen.png`
   - `05_settings_screen.png`
   - etc.

### Option 2: Figma Link 🔗

1. **Make your Figma file shareable**
2. **Copy the share link**
3. **Save it** in a file called `figma_link.txt` in this folder

### Option 3: Export Assets 📦

1. **Export icons** → Save in `assets/icons/`
2. **Export images** → Save in `assets/images/`
3. **Export design tokens** → Save as `design_specs.md`
